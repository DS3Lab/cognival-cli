Cynthia, called Mrs. Inglethorp, do you think you could write a few notes for me?
Cynthia, whose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the opening of a new and hopeful future.

Good.
Good. That's bolted.

Had Blanchett dropped a cup size, so to speak, as a result of pregnancy?
Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and Bauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband?
Had Mrs. Inglethorp, then, made several former wills?
Had a row with Alfred Inglethorp, and she's off. Evie?
Had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already seated at the table.
Had been engaged to defend him.
Had been right in her facts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.
Had been right then, and I experienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred Inglethorp's liberality with another woman's money.
Had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was the latter functionary who requested that the household, with the exception of the servants, should be assembled together in the drawing-room.
Had he any idea of what I was about to say?
Had he foreseen this arrest?
Had he not, in all probability, been the cause of it?
Had it analysed just it!
Had it been a little clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp, warned in time, would have escaped..
Had opened the door, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently.
Had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street.
Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession?
Had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.
Had that anything to do with it?
Had that piquant gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser mainspring of money?
Had they any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes?
Had walked over to the mantel-piece.
Hadn't an idea of such a thing, until Bauerstein put it into his.

Hand grenades are thrown and timed to explode a bit after that.
Hand. I don't know if it was a letter, or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept staring at it, almost as if she couldn't believe what was written.
Hand. It is.
Hand. My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr. Bauerstein.
Hand. Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray.
Hand? Yes,.
Handle. Next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring himself that the bolt had really been.

Harris is supposed to be the star of the story, but comes across as pretty dull and wooden.
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle.
Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.
Harry glanced down at his broom.
Harry grabbed his broom.
Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.
Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.
Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.
Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -- and it wasn't Malfoy.
Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.
Harry ignored her.
Harry knew, somehow, what to do.
Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
Harry nodded silently.
Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -- WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall.
Harry suggested.
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.
Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.
Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what.
Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off.
Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.

Have I no right, Mary? he said unsteadily.

Have you no friends of whom I should disapprove?
Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman?
Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage?
Have you?
Have. All I ask you is to keep your eyes.

Haven't I always hated him like poison?
Haven't I always told you he would murder her in her bed?
Haven't I always told you the man is a villain?
Haven't you heard?

He had been completely under his wife's ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons.
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
He had heard or seen something that had affected him strongly what was it?
He had last had a post in government in
He had married two years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home of his own.

He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape.
He had stood aside, and as I went out I had seen the look in Mary's eyes, as John Cavendish had caught his wife in his arms.

He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is he thought.
He is, it is said, much more sympathetic to the argument that to wait until then would sap Britain s credibility in Europe; would reduce, perhaps fatally, Britain s chances of filling the leadership vacuum in the EU, and would make it more difficult to reshape policy not least, to take one topical example, on the over-rigid stability pact, which Gordon Brown has rightly inveighed against.
He is, of course, a German by birth, said Poirot thoughtfully, though he has practiced so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as anything but an Englishman.
He is, on the contrary, a patriot.
He isn't persuaded by the argument shared by a few in Downing Street and many more in the Treasury that it would be better to wait until
He jumped up and took her cup.
He just wanted me to love wood, as he did.
He kept them straighter than anyone did so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
He knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines.
He knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started.
He knew it.
He knew only too well how useless her gallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to deny this point.
He knew that a lot was wrong with the public sector, but he did not know how to put that right.
He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth.
He knows more about poisons than almost anybody, I explained.
He later became an educator, teaching music theory at the University of the District of Columbia; he was also director of the District of Columbia Music Center jazz workshop band.
He later became president of the United Secularists of America.
He laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock despair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.
He lay in the stern in the sun compact and bullet shaped his big unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat fast moving tail.
He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin.
He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.

He may be seen leaving the room may be searched.
He might have gone with us.
He might have stowed them there in a hurry.
He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful.

He paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted: But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?
He perfectly understood: In the station to which God has called you, be who you are Madam, that is to say the person in whom your people perceive its own nationhood, and by whose presence and dignity that national unity is upheld.

Huxley was a son of the writer and editor Leonard Huxley by his second wife Rosalind Bruce, and hence half-brother of Aldous Huxley and fellow biologist Julian Huxley and grandson of the biologist T. H. Huxley.
Huxley was born in Godalming, Surrey, England.
Huxley was strongly influenced by F. Matthias Alexander and included him as a character in Eyeless in Gaza.
Hydro-chloride of strychnine, he said, over his shoulder, continuing to hum.
I -- told -- you, Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, I -- told -- you.
I accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be so positive about the matter.
I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and sent it to be analysed.
I acquiesced.
I admire the man myself.
I admit I do not wish it.
I agree with Alcohol Concern; there is no bigger health crisis facing Britain.
I almost told your brother, Hermione snapped, Percy -- he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this.
I also have to apologise to them for stopping this column for a while.
I always had hopes of that letter.
I always said he'd murder her in her bed, poor soul.
I am a boy and I must obey him I know the old man said.
I am a strange old man but are you strong enough now for a truly big fish.
I am a very bad friend.
I am absolutely serious, my friend.
I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly.
I am always watching hoping I shall be proved wrong.
I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my wife.
I am certain that you would find it.
I am charming to my friends one day, and forget all about them the next.
I am disappointed in Japp.
I am glad it has all ended so happily.
I am inclined to think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair.
I am much obliged to you for mentioning it.
I am much worried.
I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time, perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate.
I am not in the habit of listening to private conversations.
I am not keeping back facts.
I am not usually clumsy.
I am of the Devil s party, and I know it.
I am of the most serious.
I am privileged to take part in many political programmes broadcast by the corporation and I would suffer, financially, as a consequence.
I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.
I am quite sure of it.
I am referring to a little bottle of Hydro-chloride Hydro-chloride of Strychnine.
I am right, am I not? asked Poirot.
I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising.
I am sorry for that, he said.
I am sorry you were not here in time to witness.
I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done, I remarked.
I am sure of it.
I am sure she would be delighted.
I am to take it then that you decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?
I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.
I ask you nothing you will be my ally.
I asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned.
I asked earnestly, have you made up your mind about this crime? Yes.
I asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly: Yes, I've got the most beastly headache.
I assure you that you need not let it trouble you.
I at once examined the bedroom of the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept locked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy occurred.
I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.
I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr. Inglethorp's, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in Mr. Inglethorp's rather noticeable clothes.
I began rather tactfully, I thought, but I had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.
I began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn't thought again she stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove Cynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.
I believe I've only seen your hand shake once.
I believe her in all this.
I believe it too.
I believe it was.
I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.
I believe so.
I believe there was some tragedy connected with her death took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake.
I believe they have to be very careful.
I believe you're right about that man, Poirot.
I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown paper?
I believe, continued Lawrence, that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by causing death.
I bend down and rub the leaves between my fingers.
I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.
I bumped into her mother the other day outside the Post Office.
I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous detective, and he quite inflamed me.
I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp's determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took place after, and not before the making of the will.
I can always borrow two dollars and a half.
I can always come in on the glow from havana.
I can do it as long as he can he thought.
I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me he thought.
I can order one one sheet.
I can produce no less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either at six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs. Raikes's home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the village.
I can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort.
I can remember it the old man said.
I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing.
I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.
I can still row and rogelio will throw the net.
I can tell you, Hastings, it's making life jolly difficult for us.
I can tell you, Whitelaw said, that Im gloating like hell.
I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all.
I can think of two immediate candidates: the young and the poor with little money who want to get pissed fast, and the alcoholic chasing oblivion.
I can't even taste sweetness well, so when I make cookies I add extra sugar.
I can't have been alone, though, in thinking how much more powerful the scene would have been with a bit of post-production CGI work.
I can't help feeling she'd do anything against him.
I can't help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident. Because.
I can't help feeling, I continued blunderingly; that we've rather left her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her having been away from the place.
I can't think what they're after!
I cannot believe you are serious.
I cannot say it is suggestive.
I cannot tell you.
I caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them.
I come.
I conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were addressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish.
I consented rather stiffly.
I could go if there's anything special.
I could go with you again.
I could hardly believe my ears.
I could have cleared him it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals.
I could have told him from the beginning that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley, but I restrained my tongue.
I could hear Poirot shouting and expounding.
I could just drift he thought and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me.
I could not disguise my pleasure.
I could not help laughing.
I could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his little ideas had come to naught.
I could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began slowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.
I could only conclude that Poirot was mad. Japp.
I could see by the expression of his face that he fully appreciated the difficulty of the position.
I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it.
I couldn't believe it at the time.
I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying -- Bet you could, Ron muttered.
I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying — Bet you could, Ron muttered.
I couldn't say.
I dare say he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.
I dare say, observed Summerhaye sarcastically. Japp.
I daren't do it, Mr. Poirot.
I defy anyone to say that a native English speaker has a worse ear for languages than a native French, German, Italian or Spanish speaker.
I did go back and check out the last
I did not know it.
I did not myself think very highly of Lawrence's intelligence; but I forebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for forgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia's days off.
I did not quite know what to say.
I did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart knock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the two detectives waiting for us below. Poirot.
I did not recognize them.
I did not reply.
I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods, returning to the house about five.
I did not trouble to correct the quotation.
I did not undervalue the victory over an Ireland side who, as they showed against Scotland on Saturday, can pile up points even though they may be losing the set pieces.
I did not want to mention the name of the person who was actually in my mind.
I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard.
I did not wonder that the blood rose to John's face in a crimson tide.
I did not, of course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell into a grievous error.
I did, but it contains no information.
I didn't bother to find out.
I didn't know as there was a beard up there at all.
I didn't know it was of any importance.
I didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube, and his skinny buddy Mike Epps, to make like Laurel and Hardy'n the hood.
I didn't see it either until now.
I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say. Poirot.
I do not know, said Poirot.
I do not know.
I do not like for him to waken me.
I do not say that.
I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question.
I do not think he believes or cares anything!
I do not think so.
I do not think there has ever been a time when there has been so much coverage.
I do not think watched him narrowly you quite realize the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest.
I do not think, monsieur, said Poirot pointedly, that you quite realize how terrible it may be you.
I do not usually label myself as dense, but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted my attention.
I do not, I may say, seriously suppose that such a competition will come about in the immediate future or, perhaps, ever.
I do this for you I wish I could feed the fish he thought.
I do wish I knew what it was all.
I do.
I don t know the boy said.
I don t know what that fish was that took the bait just now.
I don t think I can eat an entire one he said and drew his knife across one of the strips.
I don't believe much about art but I do believe that.
I don't hold with foreigners as a rule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave Belges isn't the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he's a most polite spoken gentleman.
I don't know anything about the coffee-cups, except that we've got some that are never used, which are a perfect dream!
I don't know how to tell you.
I don't know if this has anything to do with a number of extremely attractive women from around the world working there.
I don't know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly and not in the best of taste: Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!
I don't know what possessed me.
I don't know what put such a wild a dreadful into my head!
I don't know what to make of it.
I don't know why, but she can't bear me; and he can't, either.
I don't know why.
I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know, because I never saw her.
I don't know.
I don't like him.
I don't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John, I remarked.
I don't remember precisely when I stopped buying it, but there was a time in the Eighties when I began to feel that Cosmo contained the same articles as all the other women s magazines.
I don't remember, sir.
I don't say she wasn't surrounded by sharks was.
I don't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did.
I don't see why he wished to be arrested?
I don't understand.
I don't wonder.
I drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the question of going through Mrs. Inglethorp's papers.
I drew him aside.
I drill with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms.
I dropped down obediently.
I dropped my hat from the balcony, explained Poirot simply.
I dropped my voice still lower.
I easily could have spent a week at Al Maha.
I ejaculated.
I endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.
I entered Mrs. Inglethorp's room.
I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy.
I exclaimed, much relieved.
I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I dragged him into the room.
I exclaimed.
I expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.
I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different wings of the building.
I faced the problem from a new standpoint.
I fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy.
I fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.
I fear both the tigers of detroit and the indians of cleveland.
I fear it does not help us much, said the Coroner, with a sigh.
I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.
I feel confident today.
I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world.
I felt a crunch and I knew instantly that my foot was broken.
I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.
I felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the little lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied quietly enough: No.
I felt that I was right in my opinion that Dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy.
I finally came to a stop at a flat part of the slope.
I find it ironic, however, that I have the opportunity of participating far more these days on radio and television than I ever did as an MP.
I fixed my mind on my book.
I followed John's example, and went out into the hall, where Miss Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her head.
I followed him down the steep, dark, narrow Passage.
I followed him.
I followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door, and wondering what on earth lay behind the request.
I found nature provides useful information, but more than is needed for a good painting.
I found the results rather more interesting than most author profiles, and for several weeks kept them among my papers for occasional reference.
I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain on the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of bromide powders.
I gasped.
I gave Lawrence your message, I said.
I gave a gasp.
I glanced sideways at him.
I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh!
I guessed nothing!
I had a neat haircut while freeing up the time I would have spent at the hair salon to do more important things, like download different tones for my mobile from the internet and dribble spittle on the dining room table.
I had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot's, but now my curiosity was aroused afresh.
I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in her coffee.
I had an idea clearly I was mistaken.
I had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face.
I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month's sick leave.
I had counted the cups carefully, in the event of one having been removed.
I had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he replied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad.
I had expected that answer.
I had forgotten that, I said thoughtfully.
I had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot's message to Lawrence.
I had hoped that he would have observed the stiffness of my manner.
I had just come back from a press trip to Hawaii where one morning all of us, apart from a Midlands radio presenter called Kenny, had been taken by helicopter to see some spectacular waterfalls.
I had never seen him so upset.
I had never understood his insistence on that point.
I had no quarrel with my dear wife.
I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his eyes turned green like a cat's.
I had one absolute dread, that Id finish last and be out there in the wilderness all on my own.
I had rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.
I had seen very little of him for some years.
I had some warm moments in that court; I did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to say anything at all.
I had the impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real woman.
I had to confess myself mistaken.
I had to go and live with some old aunts in Yorkshire.
I half thought he was going to rise from his chair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted expression of astonishment rose on his face.
I handed the fragment over to the police who did not consider it of much importance.
I happen to know for a fact that, far from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.
I happened to notice that it was bolted.
I hardly heard what Poirot replied.
I have a message for you, from Poirot.
I have a recurring dream about exams, even though I'm no longer in college.
I have a six-year-old son who knows the difference between a protoceratops and a diplodocus like he knows the difference between baked beans and strawberry jam.
I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe, creating an atmosphere.
I have an idea that I was out walking.
I have ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs. Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening.
I have been to the funerals of many friends who have fallen into alcoholic death.
I have been visiting an old woman in the village, she explained, and as Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would call for you.
I have behaved like an imbecile!
I have brought him back to you.
I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.
I have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before that time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing.
I have drawn certain conclusions Summerhaye.
I have drawn my own deductions, which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present.
I have enough line to handle him maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump he thought.
I have found it hard to forgive the things you said against my dear husband but I am an old woman very fond of you, Yours affectionately, Emily Inglethorpe It was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.
I have got a cousin who is nursing, I remarked.
I have kept them there myself.
I have mine left from today.
I have need of reflection.
I have no cramps and I feel strong.
I have no idea.
I have no problem with ``difficult'' movies, or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out.
I have no problem with difficult movies, or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out.
I have not had children myself but even I know that childbirth produces physiological changes.
I have not the least idea what my wife's views on the subject are.
I have not wished to open the container until you were ready.
I have numbered them,
I have prepared a list of them and addresses.
I have sent him a note.
I have the head of a sieve.
I have yesterday s paper and I will read the baseball.
I have, so far as I recall, kept nude photographs of only one author.
I heard Mrs. Inglethorp call Cynthia impatiently, and the girl started and ran back to the house.
I heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.
I heard something.
I hesitantly skied down the steep trail that my buddies convinced me to try.
I hesitated.
I honestly don't know.
I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong.
I hope you're pleased with yourselves.
I hoped and prayed it would not occur to John also.
I inquired satirically.
I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the leafy screen.
I inquired.
I interrupted. Poirot,.
I joined.
I jumped up. Poirot.
I keep going back because I love it, she says.
I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested, replied Poirot quietly.
I know it the boy said.
I know it's cliche, but I love the impact that I have on lives of my patients.
I know many other people who have the same nightmare.
I know that James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger are currently working on the third in the Terminator series of movies.
I know what it is, she accused him, you've been listening to the doctors.
I know where I can get four baits too.
I know you did not leave me because you doubted.
I know you did.
I know, but, still, who else is there?
I know.
I laughed.
I leap!
I left something to be analysed.
I let you carry things when you were five years old.
I like lots of hot sauce, and I drink my coffee with no cream, so it's very bitter.
I like the beer in cans best.
I like the new footage and still love the old stuff.
I like you for that.
I lived among the Cornish once and recall more than one occasion when the word went around that there were valuables being washed in on the tide.
I ll be back when I have the sardines.
I ll be right back.
I ll eat some more for you he ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two.
I ll get the cast net and go for sardines.
I ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
I ll try to get him to work far out the boy said.
I ll waken you in time.
I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.
I look out of the window and see below me the clear, calm turquoise waters of the Gulf.
I looked at Poirot in silent amazement.
I looked at Poirot.
I looked at him curiously.
I looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and amusement.
I looked at.
I looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.
I looked thoughtfully down the corridor in front of me.
I looked with some curiosity at Alfred darling'.
I love the robust middle of this picture.
I loved Cosmo, devouring it with the same enthusiasm I felt for The Female Eunuch, which had been published only two years earlier.
I m being towed by a fish and I m the towing bitt I could make the line fast.
I m ready now the old man said.
I made a bad turn and I found myself tumbling down.
I made a mistake.
I made but a slight gesture know Poirot's gestures the left hand, and over went the table by the bed!
I may not be as strong as I think the old man said.
I mean, I know our only crime in the first place was to be somewhere where a load of people from Europe wanted to be, but theres too many powerful forces ranged against us, so all of your mates at the PLO high command have decided we re going to knock the whole protest on the head.
I mean, explained Poirot, you are sure it was bolted, and not merely locked?
I mean, said Poirot deliberately, that you are suspected of poisoning your wife.
I mean, that was one of the things that charmed me about the age group in this book how free they are of so many of the assumptions and prejudices that we all grew up with in the Sixties.
I meant Lawrence.
I meant to do so, but I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the coffee on the hall table.
I mention this because, until now, palaeontology has rubbed shoulders with popular culture only in the BBC series Walking With Dinosaurs which, as brilliant as it was, tended to drag once youd marvelled at the special effects for long enough and in the irritating form of Ross in the sitcom Friends.
I merely obtained them for comparison.
I merely realized that it was possible, from your story, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard.
I mounted accordingly. Poirot.
I mused, won over to Poirot's views for the moment, although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one.
I must be getting very stupid.
I must be mad to think of such a thing. Poirot.
I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about.
I must confess that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous.
I must do them again.
I must fix it up with him.
I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket.
I must have an ally in the house, he observed reflectively.
I must have made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: Oh, yes, he did!
I must have water here for him the boy thought and soap and a good towel.
I must make him see the gravity of his position.
I must not appear in the case.
I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong.
I must say But I stopped suddenly.
I must say I think you might have given me a hint.
I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the plight he was in on Tuesday.
I must say I was surprised the jury didn't bring it in Wilful Murder against him right off.
I must see our agent over those estate.
I must thank him I thanked him already the boy said.
I myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see them continually.
I myself nearly had the same idea.
I myself, in company with the police, went to the deceased's room, and whilst there I, apparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found that, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.
I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen, remarked Poirot. Japp.
I need not have worried.
I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this most tragic affair.
I never expected that.
I never felt him I had to get rid of him too fast.
I never thought of looking.
I never thought of that.
I nodded.
I normally rush for the door when I hear a politician or civil servant droning on about co-ordinated strategy.
I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged.
I observe to Joanna that it s really quite vulgar, being famous, and she concedes that it is.
I observed John.
I once studied to be a doctor.
I only needed time to wash.
I only.
I opened my door, continued Mary, and listened.
I ought to know own father was a doctor.
I paid very little attention to my mother's actual words.
I pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a manner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy.
I perceive your thoughts, mon ami, said Poirot, smiling at me.
I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding.
I poured it out, yes.
I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight o'clock, whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening.
I privately thought that Poirot was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas.
I proceeded to reason on that assumption.
I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!
I put it to you that you did do so?
I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement!
I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp's clothes, with a black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there signed the register in his name!
I put them in salt in the box.
I questioned Poirot mutely.
I quite like Joanna Trollope; shes warm, engaged and responsive, and clearly has her heart in approximately the right place.
I quite understand.
I rather resented his not taking me into his confidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was driving at.
I read every review, and the bad ones, if written by someone I admire, I take really to heart; I mean I think we can all profit from them.
I read that rubbish and think of a man who choked to death on his own vomit, a man who died of heart failure and wasn't found for a week, the beautiful woman with an angel s voice found bloated and poisoned on her kitchen floor, a man who died far from those he loved in a small room in a town where nobody knew him.
I realized the significance of this.
I really can't remember.
I really did not know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose.
I really do not remember hearing anything.
I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point.
I really wonder that I did not think of it myself. Poirot.
I recalled her as an energetic, autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful.
I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her departure, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in Middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging me to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be.
I reflected.
I remember I chose one image of Mother Theresa and wrote, From what Ive read about this woman she was a rather nasty piece of work.
I remember making ice cream at home as a child.
I remember the old man said.
I remember the thrill of acquiring my first bottle of real perfume, a tiny phial of Diorella, through one of its special offers.
I remember years ago that I visited a restaurant in Covent Garden with Lenny Henry.
I remembered Mary as she lay white and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening.
I remembered how Poirot had relied on my diplomacy.
I remembered that Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way.
I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs. Inglethorp had written the night before.
I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance.
I run!
I said bolted, meaning that it was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside.
I said it quite quietly.
I said nothing, and after a moment, she went on: Don't misunderstand me.
I said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.
I said right out: You're an old woman, Emily, and there's no fool like an old fool.
I said, after studying the thing for a minute or two.
I said, looking out of the window.
I said, rather taken aback.
I said, what was in this particular little bottle? Poirot.
I said, your gaiety does not deceive me.
I saw a strange look come into Dorcas's eyes.
I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred.
I saw everyone only once.
I saw him put it down there.
I saw someone whod worked there
I saw the official caution Anything you say will be used in evidence against you, actually hovering on Summerhaye's lips. Poirot.
I saw to that.
I say, that's playing it a bit low down, I protested.
I say, what was the end of that message?
I see everything now, said Lawrence.
I see only one.
I see.
I seemed to see her for a moment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills.
I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me something about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last.
I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!
I shall go round the long way through the woods.
I shall keep my eye on our clever Dr. Bauerstein.
I shall never forget it.
I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish.
I shall never forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he called it sort of Eastern King it was.
I shall never forget them.
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule.
I shook my head helplessly.
I shook my head, unconvinced.
I shook my head.
I shot a quick glance at Mary.
I should consider it very unlikely.
I should fancy he had found her very useful, remarked Poirot.
I should have carried it away with me.
I should like to see a good flare up.
I should like to see them! cried Cynthia with dignity.
I should never have left that case here.
I should never have suspected them of being official personages.
I should not think it likely.
I should put it this way.
I should say doctor was continuing I would have been considerably surprised at any other result.
I should say, are a man's finger-prints; thumb and first finger.
I should think some one had taken charge of it.
I showed them all our exhibits.
I shrank from blurting it out. If only.
I shrugged my shoulders.
I shrugged my.
I shudder to think what might happen if such a boat arrived at Punta Espinosa and disgorged everyone on to Fernandina Island at the same time.
I sighed.
I speak!
I stared at the two men intently.
I start training next week, said Harry.
I steady my nerves, that is all.
I stepped briskly down the stairs.
I still think you might have given me a hint.
I stood faithfully at my post.
I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree.
I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted.
I studied the proofs attentively.
I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.
I suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs, when he was Shah of Persia?
I suppose every one has.
I suppose she forgot, or didn't think she was likely to die I am not provided for!
I suppose so too!
I suppose they have very strong poisons there?
I suppose they took advantage of our all being out.
I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key was forgotten he did not take it after all?
I suppose you know that she has married again?
I suppose you think it nonsense?
I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur, what first led you to suspect the fact? Poirot.
I suppose, I said, that as usual, you are not going to explain?
I suppose, said Lawrence quietly, that I should.
I suspect the truth is that while Joanna remains so in thrall to the way she and her work are received by the world, there are plenty more little lacerations in store for her.
I sympathised slightly.
I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?
I tell you, Mary, I won't have it.
I tell you, mon ami, it puzzles me. Me Poirot!
I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year, said Fred.
I thawed.
I think I have finally found the artistic field that I should be in, a field where tiny numbers still denote huge success, where the minuscule number of twisted, supercilious malcontents who find me funny can make a gigantic difference to the percentages of sales figures.
I think I'll be getting back.
I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?
I think Joanna s quite modest, but not as modest as she would like to be.
I think am sure cared for me at first.
I think every one was a little surprised that it should be he and not one of the official detectives who took the initiative.
I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell more if she chose.
I think it s a good time to leave newspaper writing for a while, it s not like theres anything much going on in the world to write about.
I think nothing.
I think perhaps I can too.
I think so I must give him something more than the belly meat then he is very thoughtful for us.
I think so and there are many tricks.
I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.
I think that for the first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a tangible reality.
I think that schools appreciate what we do because they realise that without the agencies these jobs would be much harder to fill, he says.
I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a shock to John, though of course after the verdict, he had realized that it was only a matter of time.
I think the brouhaha that surrounds poor youthful Joanna has as much to do with her rotten old borough of a constituency as it does with anything intrinsic to her.
I think the pharmacy profession chose me as much as I chose to be a pharmacist.
I think the truth is that her interviewees whom Joanna obtains by word of mouth come from exactly her milieu, and that explains why they all sound rather like characters in a Joanna Trollope novel.
I think they are equal.
I think they would have, if it hadn't been for the Coroner seemed to be holding them back.
I think we'll be okay -- get off, Neville!
I think we've lost him, Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead.
I think, Mr. Cavendish, said Poirot gravely, that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any FALSE hopes.
I thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up Poirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once gave him Dorcas's message.
I thought Id reached paradise: an empty beach, half an hour from the nearest petrol station and small shop, car-free dirt roads and locally grown fruit and vegetables.
I thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and far off.
I thought not.
I thought that I didn't need anybody else, I thought I could do it for myself, I was arrogant and vain, and as a result I am now forced to go out only at night, to slink through the streets of Bloomsbury with my hideous visage covered by a long, black hooded cloak.
I thought the relationships were wonderful, the comedy was funny, and the love `real'.
I thought the relationships were wonderful, the comedy was funny, and the love real'.
I thought you thought so too? Poirot.
I thought, This is a really strange arts project.
I told him Wednesday was the one day she wasn't there!
I told him about the letter.
I told him of Poirot's intense excitement on hearing that Dr. Bauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added: He said twice: That alters everything.
I told him, what was true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him more, but that I was not in any way what the world calls in love with him.
I took a sample from each cup, and had them analysed no result.
I took an early opportunity of testing that statement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of the building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish's door.
I took an early opportunity of verifying my conjectures.
I took my stand from the first.
I trembled.
I turned to Mary with a gesture of despair.
I understand now.
I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss Howard?
I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for that of Mr. Inglethorp.
I understand, I said, but don't do anything rash.
I understand, continued the Coroner deliberately, that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir.
I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel.
I understood his object.
I use the two levers in front of me to control the machine.
I uttered an exclamation.
I utterly reject and disapprove of Sir Ernest Heavywether's insinuations against my brother.
I ve been asking you to the boy told him gently.
I waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.
I walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard.
I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.
I want to ask your advice.
I want to be able to count upon your help.
I want to be out before it is light.
I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.
I want to make it wet again, Elizabeth announced.
I want to see a significant reduction in the use of plastic shopping bags and a subsequent reduction in the number of bags that end up as litter.
I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid.
I was a little annoyed.
I was a teenage reader of Cicero and Jackie, T S Eliot and Georgette Heyer, so I wasn't at all discomfited to find Nobel-prize winning novelists and male pin-ups in the same magazine.
I was a total rookie and was pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing, she says.
I was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words distracted me.
I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.
I was afraid our house would be ripped from its foundation.
I was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot.
I was aware of other servants huddled together in the background, all eyes and ears.
I was compelled to shake my head.
I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.
I was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it's not being my business to think anything of the sort.
I was devastated to finish so far back and I loathe talking about getting the Red Lantern.
I was dumbfounded.
I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but I had to make sure.
I was fascinated by the neatly arranged bottles in pharmacies as a child.
I was fast asleep.
I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone, and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism.
I was foolish, no doubt, murmured Inglethorp.
I was getting angry.
I was hurt, and showed it. Poirot.
I was lucky to get him instead of dolphin.
I was miserable, and I then had stringers from the Daily Mail all over my patch in the country, my mother...everyone you can think of, trying to get people to rubbish me.
I was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me back.
I was never so glad to see anyone.
I was not sure then if Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he would not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere, and by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually prevent his destroying it.
I was not surprised.
I was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature.
I was now sure that one, or possibly both of the gardeners there were two sets of footprints in the bed entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window, and they would not have come into the room at all.
I was on a different footing.
I was once shown round a vomitorium, where middle-class Romans went to bring back their dinners.
I was one of those original readers.
I was opening my lips, when Poirot stopped me with a gesture of his hand.
I was pleased with the compliment.
I was puzzled.
I was quite honest with him.
I was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed on to John what I believed to be Poirot's views concerning Bauerstein.
I was rather startled.
I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below.
I was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered painful grip.
I was relieved.
I was silent.
I was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict being given: Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.
I was told there had been a quarrel between my mother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was not really the case.
I was told, before I came, that I wouldn't want to spend more than a night as there is nothing to do.
I was trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at once.
I was very comfortable where I was.
I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain.
I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.
I watched her as she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic.
I watched him suspiciously. Poirot,.
I watched over her.
I watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story.
I went on, I'm going to warn you, whether you like it or not.
I whispered eagerly. Poirot.
I whispered.
I will ask you nothing.
I will eat it all and then I will be ready.
I will go with you.
I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good catalan cardel and the hooks and leaders.
I will make a father confessor of you.
I will merely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was duly committed for trial.
I will mount to my room.
I will not describe to you the special apparatus, dusting powder, etc.,.
I will not go into the details of the police court proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions.
I will put my question in another form.
I will reconstruct for you as far as possible.
I will remember.
I will show you.
I will some day, if you ask me, she promised him, smiling.
I will take it to.
I will take the things back to the terrace.
I will tell him, Dorcas, I promised.
I will tell you why, interrupted Poirot.
I will tell you why.
I will tell you, my friend: Because they are both clean-shaven men.
I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair.
I wish I could see him I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.
I wish I did.
I wish I had some salt.
I wish he would turn with the current.
I wish the boy was here he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.
I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt he said aloud.
I wish this story had a happy ending for theres no reason why stories about fat people shouldn't.
I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it's quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor's certificate.
I woke up with a start.
I won't admit it, even to myself.
I won't cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish.
I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today he thought.
I wonder if we've time to pick up Cynthia.
I wonder what he made that lurch for he thought.
I wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point. Poirot.
I wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his face.
I wondered whether, if she had remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would the man have feared her watchful eyes?
I wondered.
I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing he thought.
I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the present, but what you say is very just word of a Belgian policeman, whose day is past, is not enough!
I would like to ask you one question.
I would like to go.
I would like to take the great dimaggio fishing the old man said.
I would like to think that the Cornish have been out in their thousands, thronging the shoreline to marvel at this glorious sight art rescued from the wreck of commerce, destruction itself destroyed.
I would not want to suggest that the US is about to go down Japan s path.
I would rather like to see that dispensary of hers.
I wouldn't lift a finger to.
I wrote for it occasionally myself, on subjects as varied as Ian McEwan s fiction and the return of the corset as a fashion item.
I yawned again.
I yield to no one in my scepticism of focus groups.
I'd feel it in my fingertips if he came near me.
I'd forgotten that, I admitted.
I'd love him to see it.
I'd take you on anytime on my own, said Malfoy.
I'd take your word, but there's others over me who'll be asking what the devil I mean by it.
I'll admit that it wasn't he who bought strychnine at the chemist's shop.
I'll go and see if it's there now. Poirot.
I'll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure, she replied gruffly.
I'll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself.
I'm busy.
I'm coming with you, she said.
I'm his second, who's yours?
I'm looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked this way.
I'm much obliged to you.
I'm not being silly.
I'm not sure which will take longer to heal: the welt on Johnny Knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche.
I'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful, I responded.
I'm sure of that. Japp.
I'm sure you are mistaken.
I've been looking for you, I remarked untruthfully.
I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed.
I've given up trying to guess what he'll do next.
I've got.
I've had enough of the fellow hanging about.
I've never even done any of the reading assignments.
I've never seen anything like it.
I've told Mary to keep them apart if she can.
I, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist's shop, and purchased strychnine at six o'clock on Monday last was not Mr. Inglethorp, for at six o'clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting Mrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm.
I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I lack the last link in my chain.
I, also, am of your way of thinking.
I.
I. What was all this about a lost.
I?

John glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.
John interrupted just as I had done.
John introduced us both, and explained the reason of our presence.
John left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking slowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch.

John strode on ahead and I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot: There will be an inquest then? Poirot.
John stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up to Mrs. Inglethorp's room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking through the desk in the boudoir.
John turned.
John was in the smoking-room. Poirot.
John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.
John will show you your room.
John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry to let her go.
John, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the window as it swept past. Evie!
John, of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.
John, who had gone into the house, now reappeared.

Messieurs, mesdames, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur John Cavendish to investigate this case.
Messieurs, mesdames, said Poirot, with a flourish, let me introduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp! Poirot,.

Midnight all right?
Might behave, better still, like Bart Simpson.
Might have excellent reasons for his belief in Inglethorp's innocence, but a man of the type of Summerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot could supply.

Miss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her voice.
Miss Howard entered.
Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham.
Miss Howard had always seemed to me so essentially honest uncomfortably so. Poirot.
Miss Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs. Raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards.
Miss Howard nodded grimly.
Miss Howard occupied very much the same position, so I used her name instead.
Miss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on the evening of the
Miss Howard rose immediately from her seat.
Miss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her shoulder at John.
Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip.
Miss Howard was obviously quite a public character.
Miss Howard will have engineered her quarrel, and departed from the house.
Miss Howard's evidence, unimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity.
Miss Howard, I explained.
Miss Howard, I will ask you one question.
Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day of my friend's arrival here?
Miss Howard, in particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings.
Miss Howard, said Poirot gravely, this is unworthy of you.
Miss Howard.
Miss Howard?
Miss Howard? Yes.
Miss Murdoch too, I continued, there's nothing untruthful about her.
Mistress! Suddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us he alone had given no sign of his.

Mr. Hastings are always so kind, and you know such a lot.
Mr. Hastings, she said, do you think I and my husband are happy together?
Mr. Hastings, you do not think think it could not have been Lawrence no, that could not be!
Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.
Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to Mr. Wells and myself.
Mr. Inglethorp's reason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had forgotten the latch-key.
Mr. Inglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to say where you were at six o'clock on Monday afternoon?
Mr. Inglethorp, said Poirot, addressing him directly, a very dark shadow is resting on this house shadow of murder. Inglethorp.
Mr. Inglethorp, said the Coroner, you have heard your wife's dying words repeated here.
Mr. Lawrence, he's wonderful.
Mr. Mace began at once.
Mr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him to Mr. Inglethorp.
Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?

Mr. Poirot, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that you'd just come back from the Hall?
Mr. Poirot, here, will show me the way.
Mr. Soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious.
Mr. Wells bowed his head.
Mr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily: Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?
Mr. Wells smiled faintly.
Mr. Wells to see you, sir, she said to John.
Mr. Wells told me as we were going upstairs.
Mr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the typical lawyer's mouth.
Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe, but effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle Cynthia.
Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her.
Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman.
Mrs. Cavendish is in her mother-in-law's mother-in-law's room.
Mrs. Cavendish must think I am working for her husband, not against him.
Mrs. Cavendish's behaviour could only be explained that way.
Mrs. Cavendish's clear voice startled me.
Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.
Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to give evidence against her husband.
Mrs. Cavendish, startled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet.
Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done.
Mrs. Cavendish, who had married John's father when he was a widower with two sons, had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her.
Mrs. Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time, as she dealt with Coot's, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster.
Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine that night.
Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.
Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she occasionally took at night.
Mrs. Inglethorp had made no provisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would probably insist on her making her home with them any rate until the end of the war.
Mrs. Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk.
Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice, who, he fears, may be in a panic at the nonsuccess of their plan.
Mrs. Inglethorp left her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep up Styles.
Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though, unfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to her mind.
Mrs. Inglethorp said something do not remember exactly what causing scandal between husband and wife.
Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night.
Mrs. Inglethorp, however, seemed to notice nothing unusual.
Mrs. Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills, makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.

My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some salt on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs. Inglethorp's room.
My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing.
My brother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.
My dear Evelyn, cried Mrs. Cavendish, this can't be true!
My dear Evie, do be careful.
My dear Evie, don't shout so.
My dear Poirot!
My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy!
My dear Poirot, I expostulated, I never thought it would interest you.
My dear fellow, I said, is this wise?
My dear fellow, that's just what I want.
My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again?
My dearest Emily!
My do-it-yourself haircut seemed to be a confirmation of an idea that had been at the back of my mind since the time I started losing my hair to male-pattern baldness.
My father thinks he was the greatest.
My father was English, said Mrs. Cavendish, but my mother was a Russian.
My father was one of those men who went nowhere without a saw in his hand, a sheet of sandpaper in his pocket and nails in his mouth.
My friend, besought Poirot, I implore you, do not enrage yourself!
My friend, he broke out at last, I have a little idea, a very strange, and probably utterly impossible idea.
My friend, replied Poirot, I do not know what you are talking about.
My friends were sick of watching me gamble my savings away.
My god, I'm behaving like an idiot!
My good Dorcas, I have an idea little idea it should prove justified, what magnificent chance!
My heart would race for no reason, and I even felt dizzy at times.
My hostess turned to me.
My idea was very ridiculous one, no doubt she had intended to poison him that, in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake.
My instinct was right.
My interest was aroused.
My jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once: No, mon ami, I am not in my second childhood!
My mind is in some disorder is not well.
My momentary annoyance vanished. Poirot.
My mother came to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now.
My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I believe, he said. Poirot.
My mother was only buried on Saturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.
My mother was very beautiful, I believe.
My mother's lawyer, he explained.
My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was taking a tonic containing strychnine.
My old friend John!
My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss Howard.
My poor friend!
My poor wife, he murmured.
My pride forbade me to ask any questions. Poirot.
My room was in the left wing, and looked out over the park.
My sense of taste isn't very good, so I tend to eat foods with very strong flavors.
My skis were nowhere to be found and my poles were lodged in a snow drift up the hill.
My system is based on his of course I have progressed rather further.

My thoughts of mankind were kindly and charitable.

Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one.

Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.

Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch-case.

She admits, quite shamelessly, that she conducts numerous interviews as part of the research for her novels, but when I put it to her that this suggests she doesn't have much faith in her imagination, she vehemently asserts: Im not looking for information; Im looking for what I expect to be the case to be confirmed.
She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy.

She certainly could not be a day less than seventy now.

She could not be implicated I should have heard some hint of it.
She could not have committed the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not debar her from being an accomplice.

She freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.
She gave her entire fortune to her stepson, Mr. John Cavendish.

She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper.
She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, Alohomora!
She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted John's invitation.
She had accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error.
She had been singing and dancing since childhood and after graduating from high scool in Little Rock, she went to study drama at girl's college in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania before completing her education at the University of Texas in Austin.

She had, about a year before, executed a will in favour of the prisoner.
She had, however, little to tell.

She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.
She has authored or co-authored eight books and numerous articles.

She has provoked much criticism before and since Cobain s death in

She just told Willum to go on his bicycle down to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like don't know what exactly wrote it down for him.

She later moved yet further from her Boston-based persecutors, to what is now The Bronx in northern New York City.

She looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.
She looked excited and determined, and slightly on the defensive.
She looked perplexed.
She looked very tired and ill, I thought.
She looks, in fact, like what she is: a million selling lady novelist of a certain age.
She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper paper where she'd signed.

She meant, replied Poirot promptly, that she found it on top of a wardrobe.
She might have been a statue but for the glow of her eyes.
She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour.

She never let people forget what she had done for them that way she missed love.
She nodded.
She opened the door and poked her head inside.
She paused a long time, and said at last: Perhaps I want to be.
She paused a minute, and added in a different tone: And then I met John Cavendish.
She paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.
She picks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia's room, closing the door behind her.
She pressed her wings to her sides and settled down, half-closing an eye.
She put off her project until the early hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time.
She puts the beard in the attic.
She raised her hand and adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as she did so.
She ranged herself passionately on her husband's side, scorning the mere idea of his guilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.
She resumed work today.
She said that she did not mind at all.
She sat up at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity: Don't be silly!
She says that she continues to publicise her books quite as much as she does because shes always waiting to go out of fashion, because with every book I think this will be it...and I suppose Ive had a sort of superstition about prolonging that moment, but that after last week Im asking myself very seriously why.
She says that the remarks about sex she made were general, rather than specific to her, and were quite misrepresented.
She says to me at one point: Theyre not politicised like my generation were at university.
She seemed grave, almost sad.
She seemed living in the memory of those old glad days.
She seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.
She served from
She shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.
She shuddered.
She smiled, and so did I.
She smiled.
She stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some deeper meaning into his words.
She stared at me.
She stood up, glaring at them.
She stood very upright, and spoke in a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice.
She stopped suddenly, and looked up at me.
She studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my great surprise: You are loyal to your friend.
She then appeared in minor roles in another four films until landing a supporting role under star Roy Rogers in a
She therefore opened the desk, and in searching for the stamps she came across something else slip of paper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant for Mrs. Inglethorp's eyes.

She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.
She would be one of the last people to take her own life.

Vultures seldom attack healthy animals, but may kill the wounded or sick.

Waiting outside the fitting rooms of a Kings Road shop the other day, I was surprised and dismayed not by how fat kids are these days but how unhealthily skinny they are, especially teenage girls.
Wake up old man the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man s knees.
Wake up to a different view.
Wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned him to.
Walls are usually made of stone, brick, or cement, as well as drywall.
Walls delineate a building, support the roof, and divide the space into rooms.

Was I to report who came or went?
Was a TRUE prophet.
Was called and, after being examined on other points, was questioned as to the parcel.
Was continuing: The temperature on that day, messieurs, was
Was fidgeting nervously.
Was he at last convinced of Alfred Inglethorp's guilt?
Was he pleased, or disappointed?
Was indeed creating a bad impression.
Was it a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind when he parted from me a few hours earlier?
Was it his claws, his tongue, his colour, his reptilian mien, the mysterious smile on his face, or perhaps his female companion?
Was it not plain to you that I was speaking of two entirely different persons?
Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp's mind was deranged?
Was it to stop that denunciation that the crime had been committed?
Was most obvious.
Was not that the question, Mr. Cavendish unfair to her other stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?
Was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.
Was sitting a little by himself think, unconsciously, every one had drawn his chair slightly away from him he gave a faint start as Poirot pronounced his name.
Was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands.
Was sobered at once.
Was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his scrutiny of Poirot.
Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?
Was the drawer unlocked?
Was the first witness called when the trial was reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly.
Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy or light? Heavyish.
Was there a similar resolution about Airey Neave s contempt for those in the Labour Party whom Tory paranoia in the Seventies deemed to be about to paint England s green and pleasant land a shade of Soviet red?
Was this the monstrous possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?
Was this what they had meant?
Was! I must hurry on, I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I was.
Was. But now there's only old Manning, and young William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and.
Was. It had never been.

Way. I leave it in your.
Way. Perhaps four o'clock it may have been a bit.
Way? Only three now,.
We acquiesced and followed him out of the room.
We all know this hand-writing and.
We all lived in a blast of publicity.
We all looked at each other.
We always keep it in the hall drawer.
We are at one then, said Poirot, for I, too, want to hang the criminal.
We are face to face with an entirely new problem.
We are going through my mother's papers.
We are in at the birth, in fact, of the most intensively manipulated cinema weve ever known and that manipulation will not always be bent solely on making teenagers moan awesome.
We are in close touch with our Irish colleagues on environmental issues, and though it s not something we have in mind, we will watch the results of the Irish initiative with interest.
We are just such very poor savers, now with new excuses about the untrustworthy nature of the financial services industry.
We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.
We are not just there for emergency cover we also help head teachers find long term solutions to hard-to-fill vacancies.
We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning being so long in making their appearance.
We are on top of the project all the time, and we accordingly have very few casualties.
We are quite a war household; nothing is wasted here scrap of waste paper, even, is saved and sent away in sacks.
We are shown around the stables by trainer Nick Robb.
We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind.
We are working together towards a common end.
We arrived back in a very cheerful.
We ban cigarette advertising from television but allow the continued flogging of booze.
We can do that the boy said.
We can welcome that and still accept the need to maintain the distinction between these and more frivolous or dubious reasons why parents might want to opt for genetic pre-selection.
We come to a little difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.
We conversed on the war, and other outside topics.
We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled.
We do not agree, eh? said Poirot.
We don't like the sink or swim mentality.
We don't say thank you to somebody for a job well done over many years and at the very same ceremony, so to speak, when the presentations are made and the speeches given, loudly discuss whether it couldn't all be done better in the future.
We dream throughout the night, in cycles of about ninety minutes each.
We dry out the drunks and put them back on the street and they come back again and again.
We entered the house by one of the windows.
We followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.
We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.
We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me down to Styles to spend my leave there.
We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested that we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our way, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her.
We had just done a TV show together called OTT which had caused a big furore and had been a disaster so big that Id returned from Birmingham where the show was made with somebody else s tail between my legs.
We had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his own room.
We had reached the cottage.
We had read of such things we ourselves were actors in the drama.
We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which Mrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death.
We had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate into the garden.
We halt as the camel caravans cross the road ahead with that distinctive swaying camel gait.
We have all learnt not to ask writers to give us any moral messages.
We have already seen the Israeli government of Ariel Sharon taking advantage of last Tuesday s attacks in New York by invading Palestinian areas and murdering their citizens more or less at random.
We have cleared away the manufactured clues.
We have credit here he walked off bare footed on the coral rocks to the ice house where the baits were stored.
We have given up late dinner for some time now.
We have high-alcohol drinks cynically aimed at the most vulnerable I mean imagine the marketing strategy behind Special Brew.
We have signed up thousands of students to our
We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man, and we must use any means in our power he will slip through our fingers.
We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant.
We know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings.
We know enough about economic development to realise that there are several necessary but insufficient conditions for success.
We know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison.
We know the cocoa contained no strychnine.
We know this, because later she asked Dorcas to bring her some.
We leave that for another day.
We lived, ate and slept on the boat and went ashore two or three times a day, to walk the trails, see the wildlife, and snorkel in the sea.
We ll put the gear in the boat and then get some they had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.
We may hunt together again, who knows?
We must act at once.
We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us of being intelligent at all.
We must congratulate you, is it not so?
We must delay our proceedings a few minutes until Mr. Inglethorp arrives.
We must find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually, or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there.
We must talk about this stuff that kills so many, bring the healthcare professionals, the criminal justice system, the media and the drinks industry into a public debate.
We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together, and Michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest.
We no longer know what natural women look like, but movie stars and models are no more representative than the ordinary women who are involved in a daily struggle to control their weight.
We poured the cream mixture into a frozen tub, then start turning the crank to expose it to the cold.
We prefer an intensive care approach.
We put in a lot of work matching the right people to the right job.
We ran in, grabbed some food, slammed the door, and surrendered the kitchen to the hurricane.
We re different the old man said.
We re going to have supper I m not very hungry.
We revisit the beautifully-evoked California towns of Steinbeck s youth; and we follow him into the itinerant workers camps of the Dust Bowl years, in articles that mount a ringing defence of the dignity of economic migrants.
We shall be pinched at first, of course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole financially myself.
We shall see.
We should not forget either how much employment the Spanish magazine Hola! has brought to this country for the hard working photographers and front-line journalists of Hello! , its English counterpart.
We shouldn't have been here as soon as this even, if it hadn't been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner.
We spent eight days in all, aboard a boat called Tropic Sun, visiting all parts of the islands.
We stared at one another blankly. Poirot.
We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now familiar stairs.
We value, and to want to visit, the unique and fragile environments of the world.
We ve made some money.
We waited in a tense silence. Poirot.
We walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge came to us that something was wrong.
We watch and we criticise whomever the hereditary principle places, willing or unwilling, capable or incapable, on the throne.
We went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.
We went on with the begonias, sir.
We went slowly upstairs again.
We were all together the whole time. Poirot.
We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white.
We were discussing the matter of wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.
We were in here until
We were kept back from the canvasses by a red rope a couple of feet from the wall.
We were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the Analytical Chemist. Poirot.
We were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction of Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said: Mr. Hastings.
We were sitting in the library.
We were told theres been a recent request for permission for a much larger boat to travel round the Galapagos, carrying some
We will follow its effectiveness with great interest.
We will look at the chest, although no matter will examine it all the same.
We will look through the desk in the boudoir first, explained John, and go up to her bedroom afterwards.
We will not compromise on this.
We will say that she is seeking for something and has not yet found it.
We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked.
We're on the team too -- Beaters.
We're seeing the Coroner and the doctor first.
We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower, said Ron, quickly as possible.
We've got to go, we're going to be late.
We, for our part, however, would like to stress and emphasise our intense delight in having you as a customer and look forward to renewing our most rewarding association tomorrow and for many years to come.

Well I considered.
Well and good.
Well done, said George in a low voice.
Well it s a pleasure to have you with us as a vital part of the team.
Well then, I blurted out, it's absurd I suspect Miss Howard of not telling all she knows!
Well, I grumbled, a little mollified.
Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.
Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday, and that convoy coming in unexpectedly had kindly offered to remain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted.
Well, I said consolingly, it will be the other way about tomorrow.
Well, I said, encouraged, as the person who entered did not do so by the window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself.
Well, I said, with a sigh, we will acquit Miss Howard, then.
Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.
Well, I will tell you this.
Well, I will tell you.
Well, I've always had a secret hankering to be a detective!
Well, Monsieur Poirot, said Miss Howard impatiently, what is it?
Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish's evidence for instance?
Well, a second's there to take over if you die, said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie.
Well, blank despair at any rate.
Well, don't let him have too much of it.
Well, don't you?
Well, given that Mr Blair s popularity remains undented after the pounding he has had in the last few weeks, it s difficult to see how this would happen.
Well, he did, sir.
Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp.
Well, he said at last, let us go, mon ami.
Well, how does he set about it?
Well, in about half an hour.
Well, indeed, and I don't think for a minute Joanna has self-consciously and manipulatively created a new public image to sell books.
Well, indeed, and why shouldn't she feel that way?
Well, it is difficult to explain.
Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has cared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!
Well, it was just then that Bauerstein arrived.
Well, it's just this, sir. You'll.
Well, let us leave it.
Well, mon ami, a good deal you can guess for yourself.
Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance.
Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp's guilt were very much shaken.
Well, my friend, cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, what do you think?
Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks remains to tell you the particular object on which they had been left.
Well, my idea is, that perhaps he's found some way of making strychnine tasteless.
Well, naturally.
Well, no one exactly told me, I confessed.
Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands.
Well, of course, that settles it, I said stiffly.
Well, said Mary, I expect he will be back before dinner.
Well, said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, I'm inclined to agree with you.
Well, she said quietly, whether it is your business or not, I will tell you that we are not happy.
Well, she's young.
Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do have what the young gentlemen call a dress-up night.
Well, sir, nothing much.
Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk.
Well, sir, you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?
Well, tell him to look us up tomorrow morning, will you?
Well, that depends.
Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did.
Well, then?
Well, we now know who will pay for Mr Brown s tax; the young, the pensioners of tomorrow, few of them rich.
Well, we shall see, I said, nettled.
Well, we've only his word for that.
Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.
Well, what am I to tell Poirot?
Well, what are you all waiting for? she barked.
Well, what do you think? I asked feebly.
Well, you can welcome the channel s content while still lamenting the drift towards segmentation and fragmentation that its coming represents.
Well, you might do something.
Well?
Well? I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.
Well? You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot?

What I want to ask is this: the door leading into Mrs. Inglethorp's room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia, it was bolted, you say?
What I will do if he decides to go down I don t know.
What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible.
What a disappointment I was to him.
What a fish he said.
What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted.

What a net he has drawn around my poor John!
What a rotten world it is, though!

What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?
What did he mean?
What did she do with it afterwards?

What did she.
What do they know?
What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school? said Ron finally.
What do you have to eat.

What do you want me to do? asked John, unable to help a faint smile.

What does that matter?
What effect would de Hory s Chagalls have had on gallery experts, on connoisseurs, on ravished collectors?
What extra coffee-cup?
What had Hagrid said?
What had actually occurred was this.
What had happened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my little case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up, had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot.
What had induced the deceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could not say.
What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say that Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by the bed.
What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?
What has that got to do with it? Poirot.
What have I always told you?
What have you got.

What is it, mon ami?

What is needed now is for an enterprising children s telly producer, perhaps the person behind that sickeningly cute dinosaur Barney, to make a show about twin ichthyosaurs called Ralph and Huey.
What is so unpleasant about all this is the atmosphere of blame in which it is carried out, as though getting older is a lifestyle choice made by lazy women rather than a natural process.
What is that?
What is the matter with Monsieur Poirot?
What is the matter?
What is the trouble? I asked.
What is your remarkable little friend doing? asked a voice behind me, and I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow.

You! You owe everything to.
You! said Ron furiously.

You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you, said Harry coolly.
You're all off your heads.
You're joking.
You're not a connoisseur, are you, Hastings?
You're pulling my leg!
You're quite right.
